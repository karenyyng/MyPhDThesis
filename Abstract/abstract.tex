% Context: Why observational cosmology and the study of dark matter? 

The field of observational cosmology has been one of the major driving forces
for understanding the composition and evolution of our universe. 
Discovery: galaxy rotation curves, big bang nucleosynthesis, strong lensing and
weak lensing  

Understanding Dark Matter (DM) at different length scales can
bridge a gap between two of the most successful physics models, the Standard Model for 
particle physics and the Lambda Cold 
Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmological model.
