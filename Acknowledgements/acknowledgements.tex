\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgments}

It has been an amazing journey to have completed a Ph.D degree in Physics. 
During this journey, I have met a lot of great friends, collaborators and
mentors. I would like to take the chance to thank them one by one.  

I have enjoyed the company of my great friends and classmates, Dustin (and Kayla) 
Burns, Henry Stoltenberg, Austin Peng, Xiao Rui, Qin Qin, 
Brent Follin, Alison Mansheim and 
Austin Hoag. I will not forget the
classes, the study sessions, thesis-writing sessions and 
intellectual discussions that we have had together.
I am very lucky to have two very considerate and kind housemates, Nancy Xuan He
and Hanmei, who have taken great care of me and shared witty conversations with
me.  
 
Throughout this journey, I am also glad to have crossed paths with a lot 
extraordinary physicists, statisticians and computer scientists. 
The entire list is too long to be included here. 
I really appreciate the support that I have received from the
faculty members in Cosmology, including Prof. Tony Tyson, 
Prof. Chris Fassnacht and Prof. Lori Lubin. 
 I am also grateful to Prof. Thomas Lee and Prof. Duncan Temple Lang from the
Statistics Department. Prof. Lee has shared great statistical insights and 
advice for my research projects. I have enjoyed the lectures and the workshops 
from Prof. Temple Lang on statistical computing.  
I would like to extend my gratitude to Prof. Benjamin Wandelt,  
my undergraduate advisor, who has always been a role model for me. 
He has inspired for me to learn about using Bayesian statistics 
to make inference from astrophysical data. I miss the times when we would work
out the statistical models together for our cosmology project. 
 
I am very thankful to have a responsive dissertation committee.
Prof. Marusa Bradac and Prof. Annika Peter have both provided 
invaluable scientific comments to improve this dissertation.  
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my Ph.D advisor,
Prof. David Wittman, who has given me a lot of freedom and support for 
me to explore my research interests. 

% % Family
Finally, I would like to dedicate this thesis to my family.
I would never have the courage to pursue my degrees in Physics if not for the
selfless, unlimited support of my family.  
They have provided me with resources and opportunities that they never had
themselves. 
I will make good use of the knowledge and skills that I have obtained as a way
of paying the favor forward. I am proud to have achieved the same degree as my 
better half and my best friend, Dr. Billy Lo.
