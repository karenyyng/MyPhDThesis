for using galaxy-dark matter offset to constrain SIDM}{}
\label{chapter3}

Like all other experiments that aim to probe the particle properties of
DM, this proposed study that uses galaxy-DM offset as a probe of SIDM suffers from a low signal-to-noise ratio. 
In order to confidently confirm or rule out the effects of SIDM, we need careful
statistical modeling and tests. 
In this chapter, I lay out the bare-bone probabilistic graphical model (model or PGM hereafter) for
capturing the dependence structure of various relevant variables based on the
physics of galaxy cluster mergers.  

I examine the cosmological constraints and the computational requirements.
Then I examine the required number of simulations and observational resolution for making
the model competitive for detecting effects of SIDM.\@

\subsection{Variables of the probabilistic graphical model}
$\vec{\theta}_{\Lambda CDM}$ = fixed cosmological parameters from $\Lambda
CDM$, i.e. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item $H_0 = 70~\kilo\meter~\mega {\rm pc}^{-1}~\second^{-1}$, 
	\item $\Omega_M = 0.3$, 
	\item $\Omega_\Lambda = 0.7$
\end{itemize}  
$\sigma_{SIDM}$ = self-interacting cross section, smaller cross section means dark
matter interacts less \\  
$h_{mer}$ = variables that denote merger history of the cluster, 
e.g 
\begin{itemize}
	\item non-relaxedness 
	\item time-since-pericenter
	\item impact parameter
	\item Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback
	\item gas sloshing that results in oscillation of the mass distribution 
	\item initial merger velocities etc.
\end{itemize}
since we do not have a good handle of these effects we lump them into one
variable $h_{mer}$ for now and examine them one by one later. 
\\    
$I_{g}$ = modeling assumptions or modeling uncertainty, observation window, 
selection function\\ 
$I_{D}$ = modeling assumptions, observation window, uncertainty due to modeling
methods, selection function\\   
$d_{g}$ = data of observed cluster galaxies  \\ 
$d_{D}$ = data of observed background galaxies within the cluster's field of
view  \\ 
$\psi_{g}$ = mass / luminosity distribution of galaxies in 3D  \\ 
$\psi_{D}$ = mass distribution of DM from lensing in 3D \\ 
$\eta_{g}$ = point estimate of 2D projected center of the distribution of galaxies \\ 
$\eta_{D}$ = point estimate of 2D projected center of the distribution of DM \\ 
$|\Delta \eta|$ = Euclidean distance (scalar) between the projected point estimates\\   
$\alpha$ = projection angle\\
