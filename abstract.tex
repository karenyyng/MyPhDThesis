		The field of observational cosmology has been one of the major driving
		forces for under- standing the composition and evolution of our universe.
		Discovery: galaxy rotation curves, big bang nucleosynthesis, strong lensing
		and weak lensing
		Understanding Dark Matter (DM) at different length scales can bridge a gap
		between two of the most successful physics models, the Standard Model for
		particle physics and the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (Î›CDM) cosmological model.
		Task:
