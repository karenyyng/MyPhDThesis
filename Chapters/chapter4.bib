abstract = {Two-point Correlation Function (TPCF) is widely used in astronomy to characterize the distribution of matter/energy in the Universe, and help derive the physics that can trace back to the creation of the universe. However, it is prohibitively slow for current sized datasets, and would continue to be a critical bottleneck with the trend of increasing dataset sizes to billions of particles and more, which makes TPCF a compelling benchmark application for future exa-scale architectures. State-of-the-art TPCF implementations do not map well to the underlying SIMD hardware, and also suffer from load-imbalance for large core counts. In this paper, we present a novel SIMD-friendly histogram update algorithm that exploits the spatial locality of histogram updates to achieve near-linear SIMD scaling. We also present a load-balancing scheme that combines domain-specific initial static division of work and dynamic task migration across nodes to effectively balance computation across nodes. Using Zin supercomputer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (25,600 cores of Intel{\textregistered} Xeon{\textregistered} E5-2670, each with 256-bit SIMD), we achieve 90{\%} parallel efficiency and 96{\%} SIMD efficiency, and perform TPCF computation on a 1.7 billion particle dataset in 5.3 hours (at least 35x faster than previous approaches). In terms of cost per performance (measured in flops/{\$}), we achieve at least an order-of-magnitude (11.1x) higher flops/{\$} as compared to the best known results [1]. Consequently, we now have line-of-sight to achieving the processing power for correlation computation to process billion+ particles telescopic data. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Point estimators for the shearing of galaxy images induced by gravitational lensing involve a complex inverse problem in the presence of noise, pixelization, and model uncertainties. We present a probabilistic forward modeling approach to gravitational lensing inference that has the potential to mitigate the biased inferences in most common point estimators and is practical for upcoming lensing surveys. The first part of our statistical framework requires specification of a likelihood function for the pixel data in an imaging survey given parameterized models for the galaxies in the images. We derive the lensing shear posterior by marginalizing over all intrinsic galaxy properties that contribute to the pixel data (i.e., not limited to galaxy ellipticities) and learn the distributions for the intrinsic galaxy properties via hierarchical inference with a suitably flexible conditional probabilitiy distribution specification. We use importance sampling to separate the modeling of small imaging areas from the global shear inference, thereby rendering our algorithm computationally tractable for large surveys. With simple numerical examples we demonstrate the improvements in accuracy from our importance sampling approach, as well as the significance of the conditional distribution specification for the intrinsic galaxy properties when the data are generated from an unknown number of distinct galaxy populations with different morphological characteristics.},

abstract = {Weak gravitational lensing by the large scale structure can be used to probe the dark matter distribution in the Universe directly and thus to probe cosmological models. The recent detection of cosmic shear by several groups has demonstrated the feasibility of this new mode of observational cosmology. In the currently most extensive analysis of cosmic shear, it was found that the shear field contains unexpected modes, so-called B-modes, which are thought to be unaccountable for by lensing. B-modes can in principle be generated by an intrinsic alignment of galaxies from which the shear is measured, or may signify some remaining systematics in the data reduction and analysis. In this paper we show that B-modes in fact {\{}$\backslash$it are produced{\}} by lensing itself. The effect comes about through the clustering of source galaxies, which in particular implies an angular separation-dependent clustering in redshift. After presenting the theory of the decomposition of a general shear field into E- and B-modes, we calculate their respective power spectra and correlation functions for a clustered source distribution. Numerical and analytical estimates of the relative strength of these two modes show that the resulting B-mode is very small on angular scales larger than a few arcminutes, but its relative contribution rises quickly towards smaller angular scales, with comparable power in both modes at a few arcseconds. The relevance of this effect with regard to the current cosmic shear surveys is discussed.},

Most importantly, it does not require an ingenious choice of preconditioner to work well. The method is capable of taking into account inhomogeneous noise distributions and arbitrary mask geometries. It iteratively builds up the signal reconstruction by means of a messenger field, introduced to mediate between the different preferred bases in which signal and noise properties can be specified most conveniently. Using cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation data as a showcase, we demonstrate the capabilities of our scheme by computing Wiener filtered WMAP7 temperature and polarization maps at full resolution for the first time. We show how the algorithm can be modified to synthesize fluctuation maps, which, combined with the Wiener filter solution, result in unbiased constrained signal realizations, consistent with the observations. The algorithm performs well even on simulated CMB maps with Planck resolution and dynamic range.},

We also find hyperparameters of the covariance function in the same joint optimization. The method can be viewed as a Bayesian regression model with particular input dependent noise. The method turns out to be closely related to several other sparse GP approaches, and we discuss the relation in detail. We finally demonstrate its performance on some large data sets, and make a direct comparison to other sparse GP methods. We show that our method can match full GP performance with small M, i.e. very sparse solutions, and it significantly outperforms other approaches in this regime.},

abstract = {A simple theoretical framework for the description and interpretation of spatially correlated modelling residuals is presented, and the resulting tools are found to provide a useful aid to model selection in the context of weak gravitational lensing. The description is focused upon the specific problem of modelling the spatial variation of a telescope point spread function (PSF) across the instrument field of view, a crucial stage in lensing data analysis, but the technique may be used to rank competing models wherever data are described empirically. As such it may, with further development, provide useful extra information when used in combination with existing model selection techniques such as the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria, or the Bayesian evidence. Two independent diagnostic correlation functions are described, and the interpretation of these functions is demonstrated by using a simulated PSF anisotropy field. The efficacy of these diagnostic functions as an aid to the correct choice of empirical model is then demonstrated by analysing results for a suite of Monte Carlo simulations of random PSF fields with varying degrees of spatial structure, and it is shown how the diagnostic functions can be related to requirements for precision cosmic shear measurement. The limitations of the technique, and opportunities for improvements and applications to fields other than weak gravitational lensing, are discussed.},

abstract = {We present a cosmic shear study from the Deep Lens Survey (DLS), a deep BVRz multi-band imaging survey of five 4 deg2 fields with two National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) 4 m telescopes at Kitt Peak and Cerro Tololo. For both telescopes, the change of the point-spread-function (PSF) shape across the focal plane is complicated, and the exposure-to-exposure variation of this position-dependent PSF change is significant. We overcome this challenge by modeling the PSF separately for individual exposures and CCDs with principal component analysis (PCA). We find that stacking these PSFs reproduces the final PSF pattern on the mosaic image with high fidelity, and the method successfully separates PSF-induced systematics from gravitational lensing effects. We calibrate our shears and estimate the errors, utilizing an image simulator, which generates sheared ground-based galaxy images from deep Hubble Space Telescope archival data with a realistic atmospheric turbulence model. For cosmological parameter constraints, we marginalize over shear calibration error, photometric redshift uncertainty, and the Hubble constant. We use cosmology-dependent covariances for the Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis and find that the role of this varying covariance is critical in our parameter estimation. Our current non-tomographic analysis alone constrains the $\Omega$ M -$\sigma$8 likelihood contour tightly, providing a joint constraint of $\Omega$ M = 0.262 ± 0.051 and $\sigma$8 = 0.868 ± 0.071. We expect that a future DLS weak-lensing tomographic study will further tighten these constraints because explicit treatment of the redshift dependence of cosmic shear more efficiently breaks the $\Omega$ M -$\sigma$8 degeneracy. Combining the current results with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 7 year (WMAP7) likelihood data, we obtain $\Omega$ M = 0.278 ± 0.018 and $\sigma$8 = 0.815 ± 0.020.},

abstract = {Cosmic shear is the distortion of images of distant galaxies due to weak gravitational lensing by the large-scale structure in the Universe. Such images are coherently deformed by the tidal field of matter inhomogeneities along the line of sight. By measuring galaxy shape correlations, we can study the properties and evolution of structure on large scales as well as the geometry of the Universe. Thus, cosmic shear has become a powerful probe into the nature of dark matter and the origin of the current accelerated expansion of the Universe. Over the last years, cosmic shear has evolved into a reliable and robust cosmological probe, providing measurements of the expansion history of the Universe and the growth of its structure. We review here the principles of weak gravitational lensing and show how cosmic shear is interpreted in a cosmological context. Then we give an overview of weak-lensing measurements, and present the main observational cosmic-shear results since it was discovered 15 years ago, as well as the implications for cosmology. We then conclude with an outlook on the various future surveys and missions, for which cosmic shear is one of the main science drivers, and discuss promising new weak cosmological lensing techniques for future observations.},

We present a method for searching over this space of structures which mirrors the scientific discovery process. The learned structures can often decompose functions into interpretable components and enable long-range extrapolation on time-series datasets. Our structure search method outperforms many widely used kernels and kernel combination methods on a variety of prediction tasks.},

abstract = {A number of problems in probability and statistics can be addressed using the multivariate normal (or multivariate Gaussian) distribution. In the one-dimensional case, computing the probability for a given mean and variance simply requires the evaluation of the corresponding Gaussian density. In the {\$}n{\$}-dimensional setting, however, it requires the inversion of an {\$}n \backslashtimes n{\$} covariance matrix, {\$}C{\$}, as well as the evaluation of its determinant, {\$}\backslashdet(C){\$}. In many cases, the covariance matrix is of the form {\$}C = \backslashsigma{\^{}}2 I + K{\$}, where {\$}K{\$} is computed using a specified kernel, which depends on the data and additional parameters (called hyperparameters in Gaussian process computations). The matrix {\$}C{\$} is typically dense, causing standard direct methods for inversion and determinant evaluation to require {\$}\backslashmathcal O(n{\^{}}3){\$} work. This cost is prohibitive for large-scale modeling. Here, we show that for the most commonly used covariance functions, the matrix {\$}C{\$} can be hierarchically factored into a product of block low-rank updates of the identity matrix, yielding an {\$}\backslashmathcal O (n\backslashlog{\^{}}2 n) {\$} algorithm for inversion, as discussed in Ambikasaran and Darve, {\$}2013{\$}. More importantly, we show that this factorization enables the evaluation of the determinant {\$}\backslashdet(C){\$}, permitting the direct calculation of probabilities in high dimensions under fairly broad assumption about the kernel defining {\$}K{\$}. Our fast algorithm brings many problems in marginalization and the adaptation of hyperparameters within practical reach using a single CPU core. The combination of nearly optimal scaling in terms of problem size with high-performance computing resources will permit the modeling of previously intractable problems. We illustrate the performance of the scheme on standard covariance kernels, and apply it to a real data set obtained from the {\$}Kepler{\$} Mission.},

Modern all-electrical read/write memories use instead non-relativistic spin-transport connecting the storing magnetic layer with a reference ferromagnet. Recent studies have focused on electrical manipulation of magnetic moments by relativistic spin-torques requiring no reference ferromagnet. Here we report the observation of a counterpart magnetoresistance effect in such a relativistic system which allows us to electrically detect the sign of the magnetization without an auxiliary magnetic field or ferromagnet. We observe the effect in a geometry in which the magnetization of a uniaxial (Ga,Mn)As epilayer is set either parallel or antiparallel to a current-induced non-equilibrium spin polarization of carriers. In our structure, this linear-in-current magnetoresistance reaches 0.2$\backslash${\%} at current density of {\$}10{\^{}}6{\$} A cm{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$}.},

abstract = {The statistics of shear peaks have been shown to provide valuable cosmological information beyond the power spectrum, and will be an important constraint of models of cosmology with the large survey areas provided by forthcoming astronomical surveys. Surveys include masked areas due to bright stars, bad pixels etc, which must be accounted for in producing constraints on cosmology from shear maps. We advocate a forward-modeling approach, where the impact of masking (and other survey artifacts) are accounted for in the theoretical prediction of cosmological parameters, rather than removed from survey data. We use masks based on the Deep Lens Survey, and explore the impact of up to 37{\%} of the survey area being masked on LSST and DES-scale surveys. By reconstructing maps of aperture mass, the masking effect is smoothed out, resulting in up to 14{\%} smaller statistical uncertainties compared to simply reducing the survey area by the masked area. We show that, even in the presence of large survey masks, the bias in cosmological parameter estimation produced in the forward-modeling process is {\~{}}1{\%}, dominated by bias caused by limited simulation volume. We also explore how this potential bias scales with survey area and find that small survey areas are more significantly impacted by the differences in cosmological structure in the data and simulated volumes, due to cosmic variance.},

abstract = {We address the amount of information in the non-Gaussian regime of weak lensing surveys by modelling all relevant covariances of the power spectra and bispectra, using 1000 ray-tracing simulation realizations for a {\{}Lambda{\}}cold dark matter ({\{}Lambda{\}}CDM) model and an analytical halo model. We develop a formalism to describe the covariance matrices of power spectra and bispectra of all triangle configurations. In addition to the known contributions which extend up to six-point correlation functions, we propose a new contribution  the halo sample variance (HSV)' arising from the coupling of the lensing Fourier modes with large-scale mass fluctuations on scales comparable with the survey region via halo bias theory. We show that the model predictions are in good agreement with the simulation once we take the HSV into account. The HSV gives a dominant contribution to the covariance matrices at multipoles l {\{}gtrsim{\}} 103, which arises from massive haloes with a mass of {\{}gtrsim{\}} 1014 M{\{}odot{\}} and at relatively low redshifts z [lsim] 0.4. Since such haloes are easily identified from a multi-colour imaging survey, the effect can be estimated from the data. By adding the bispectrum to the power spectrum, the total information content or the cumulative signal-to-noise ratio up to a certain maximum multipole lmax of a few 103, (S/N)lmax, is improved by 20-50 per cent, which is equivalent to a factor of 1.4-2.3 larger survey area for the power spectrum measurement alone. However, it is still smaller than the case of a Gaussian field by a factor of 3 mostly due to the HSV. Thus bispectrum measurements are useful for cosmology, but using information from upcoming surveys requires that non-Gaussian covariances are carefully estimated.},

We introduce simple closed form kernels that can be used with Gaussian processes to discover patterns and enable extrapolation. These kernels are derived by modelling a spectral density -- the Fourier transform of a kernel -- with a Gaussian mixture. The proposed kernels support a broad class of stationary covariances, but Gaussian process inference remains simple and analytic. We demonstrate the proposed kernels by discovering patterns and performing long range extrapolation on synthetic examples, as well as atmospheric CO2 trends and airline passenger data.

abstract = {We develop a Bayesian hierarchical modelling approach for cosmic shear power spectrum inference, jointly sampling from the posterior distribution of the cosmic shear field and its (tomographic) power spectra. Inference of the shear power spectrum is a powerful intermediate product for a cosmic shear analysis, since it requires very few model assumptions and can be used to perform inference on a wide range of cosmological models $\backslash$emph{\{}a posteriori{\}} without loss of information. We show that joint posterior for the shear map and power spectrum can be sampled effectively by Gibbs sampling, iteratively drawing samples from the map and power spectrum, each conditional on the other. This approach neatly circumvents difficulties associated with complicated survey geometry and masks that plague frequentist power spectrum estimators, since the power spectrum inference provides prior information about the field in masked regions at every sampling step. We demonstrate this approach for inference of tomographic shear {\$}E{\$}-mode, {\$}B{\$}-mode and {\$}EB{\$}-cross power spectra from a simulated galaxy shear catalogue with a number of important features; galaxies distributed on the sky and in redshift with photometric redshift uncertainties, realistic random ellipticity noise for every galaxy and a complicated survey mask. The obtained posterior distributions for the tomographic power spectrum coefficients recover the underlying simulated power spectra for both {\$}E{\$}- and {\$}B{\$}-modes, where the latter are recovered at a level of {\$}1{\$}-{\$}2{\$} orders of magnitude below the ellipticity noise level.},

abstract = {We have built a reliable and robust system that takes as input an astronomical image, and returns as output the pointing, scale, and orientation of that image (the astrometric calibration or WCS information). The system requires no first guess, and works with the information in the image pixels alone; that is, the problem is a generalization of the "lost in space" problem in which nothing--not even the image scale--is known. After robust source detection is performed in the input image, asterisms (sets of four or five stars) are geometrically hashed and compared to pre-indexed hashes to generate hypotheses about the astrometric calibration. A hypothesis is only accepted as true if it passes a Bayesian decision theory test against a background hypothesis. With indices built from the USNO-B Catalog and designed for uniformity of coverage and redundancy, the success rate is 99.9{\%} for contemporary near-ultraviolet and visual imaging survey data, with no false positives. The failure rate is consistent with the incompleteness of the USNO-B Catalog; augmentation with indices built from the 2MASS Catalog brings the completeness to 100{\%} with no false positives. We are using this system to generate consistent and standards-compliant meta-data for digital and digitized imaging from plate repositories, automated observatories, individual scientific investigators, and hobbyists. This is the first step in a program of making it possible to trust calibration meta-data for astronomical data of arbitrary provenance.},

abstract = {We present cosmological constraints from 2D weak gravitational lensing by the large-scale structure in the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS) which spans 154 deg2 in five optical bands. Using accurate photometric redshifts and measured shapes for 4.2 million galaxies between redshifts of 0.2 and 1.3, we compute the 2D cosmic shear correlation function over angular scales ranging between 0.8 and 350 arcmin. Using non-linear models of the dark-matter power spectrum, we constrain cosmological parameters by exploring the parameter space with Population Monte Carlo sampling. The best constraints from lensing alone are obtained for the small-scale density-fluctuations amplitude {\{}sigma{\}}8 scaled with the total matter density {\{}Omega{\}}m. For a flat {\{}Lambda{\}}cold dark matter ({\{}Lambda{\}}CDM) model we obtain {\{}sigma{\}}8({\{}Omega{\}}m/0.27)0.6 = 0.79 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.03. We combine the CFHTLenS data with 7-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP7), baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO): SDSS-III (BOSS) and a Hubble Space Telescope distance-ladder prior on the Hubble constant to get joint constraints. For a flat {\{}Lambda{\}}CDM model, we find {\{}Omega{\}}m = 0.283 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.010 and {\{}sigma{\}}8 = 0.813 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.014.

We calculate the Bayesian evidence to compare flat and curved {\{}Lambda{\}}CDM and dark-energy CDM models. From the combination of all four probes, we find models with curvature to be at moderately disfavoured with respect to the flat case. A simple dark-energy model is indistinguishable from {\{}Lambda{\}}CDM. Our results therefore do not necessitate any deviations from the standard cosmological model.},

abstract = {Context. Commonly used methods of decomposing E- and B-modes in cosmic shear, namely the aperture mass dispersion and the E/B-mode shear correlation function, suffer from incomplete knowledge of the two-point correlation function (2PCF) on very small and/or very large scales. The ring statistics, the most recently developed cosmic shear measure, improves on this issue and is able to decompose E- and B-modes using a 2PCF measured on a finite interval. Aims: First, we improve on the ring statistics' filter function over the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). Second, we examine the ability of the ring statistics to constrain cosmology and compare the results to cosmological constraints obtained with the aperture mass dispersion. Third, we use the ring statistics to measure a cosmic shear signal from CFHTLS (Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey) data. Methods: We consider a scale-dependent filter function for the ring statistics, which improves its S/N. To examine the information content of the ring statistics, we employed ray-tracing simulations and developed an expression of the ring statistics' covariance in terms of a 2PCF covariance. We performed a likelihood analysis with simulated data for the ring statistics in the sigma{\_}8 parameter space and compared the information content of ring statistics and aperture mass dispersion. Regarding our third aim, we used the 2PCF of the latest CFHTLS analysis to calculate the ring statistics and its error bars. Results: Although the scale-dependent filter function improves the S/N of the ring statistics, the S/N of the aperture mass dispersion is higher. In addition, we show that filter functions exist that decompose E- and B-modes using a finite range of 2PCFs (EB-statistics) and have higher S/N than the ring statistics. However, we find that data points of the latter are significantly less correlated than data points of the aperture mass dispersion and the EB-statistics. As a consequence the ring statistics is an ideal tool for identifying remaining systematics accurately as a function of angular scale. We use the ring statistics to measure a E- and B-mode shear signal from CFHTLS data.},

@article{Becker2013,
abstract = {In this work I study the problem of E/B-mode separation with binned cosmic shear two-point correlation function data. Motivated by previous work on E/B-mode separation with shear two-point correlation functions and the practical considerations of data analysis, I consider E/B-mode estimators which are linear combinations of the binned shear correlation function data points. I demonstrate that these estimators mix E- and B-modes generally. I then show how to define estimators which minimize this E/B-mode mixing and give practical recipes for their construction and use. Using these optimal estimators, I demonstrate that the vector space composed of the binned shear correlation function data points can be decomposed into approximately ambiguous, E- and B-mode subspaces. With simple Fisher information estimates, I show that a non-trivial amount of information on typical cosmological parameters is contained in the ambiguous mode subspace computed in this formalism. Next, I give two examples which apply these practical estimators and recipes to generic problems in cosmic shear data analysis: data compression and spatially locating B-mode contamination. In particular, by using wavelet-like estimators with the shear correlation functions directly, one can pinpoint B-mode contamination to specific angular scales and extract information on its shape. Finally, I discuss how these estimators can be used as part of blinded or closed-box cosmic shear data analyses in order to assess and find B-mode contamination at high-precision while avoiding observer biases.},

abstract = {GalSim is a collaborative, open-source project aimed at providing an image simulation tool of enduring benefit to the astronomical community. It provides a software library for generating images of astronomical objects such as stars and galaxies in a variety of ways, efficiently handling image transformations and operations such as convolution and rendering at high precision. We describe the GalSim software and its capabilities, including necessary theoretical background. We demonstrate that the performance of GalSim meets the stringent requirements of high precision image analysis applications such as weak gravitational lensing, for current datasets and for the Stage IV dark energy surveys of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, ESA's Euclid mission, and NASA's WFIRST-AFTA mission. The GalSim project repository is public and includes the full code history, all open and closed issues, installation instructions, documentation, and wiki pages (including a Frequently Asked Questions section).

abstract = {The Deep Lens Survey (DLS) is a deep BVRz' imaging survey of seven 2x2 degree fields, with all data to be made public. The primary scientific driver is weak gravitational lensing, but the survey is also designed to enable a wide array of other astrophysical investigations. A unique feature of this survey is the search for transient phenomena. We subtract multiple exposures of a field, detect differences, classify, and release transients on the Web within about an hour of observation. Here we summarize the scientific goals of the DLS, field and filter selection, observing techniques and current status, data reduction, data products and release, and transient detections. Finally, we discuss some lessons which might apply to future large surveys such as LSST.},

@article{Bunn2003,
abstract = {Separation of the E and B components of a microwave background polarization map or a weak lensing map is an essential step in extracting science from it, but when the map covers only part of the sky and/or is pixelized, this decomposition cannot be done perfectly. We present a method for decomposing an arbitrary sky map into a sum of three orthogonal components that we term ``pure E'', ``pure B'' and ``ambiguous''. This method is useful both for providing intuition for experimental design and for analyzing data sets in practice. We show how to find orthonormal bases for all three components in terms of bilaplacian eigenfunctions. The number of ambiguous modes is proportional to the length of the map boundary so fairly round maps are preferred. For real-world data analysis, we present a simple matrix eigenvalue method for calculating nearly pure E and B modes in pixelized maps. We find that the dominant source of leakage between E and B is aliasing of small-scale power caused by the pixelization. This problem can be eliminated by heavily oversampling the map, but is exacerbated by the fact that the E power spectrum is expected to be much larger than the B power spectrum and extremely blue. We found that a factor of 2 to 3 more pixels are needed in a polarization map to achieve the same level of contamination by aliased power than in a temperature map.},
