abstract = {There is almost universal agreement among astronomers that most of the mass in the Universe and most of the mass in the Galactic halo is dark. Many lines of reasoning suggest that the dark matter consists of some new, as yet undiscovered, weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP). There is now a vast experimental effort being surmounted to detect WIMPS in the halo. The most promising techniques involve direct detection in low-background laboratory detectors and indirect detection through observation of energetic neutrinos from annihilation of WIMPs that have accumulated in the Sun and/or the Earth. Of the many WIMP candidates, perhaps the best motivated and certainly the most theoretically developed is the neutralino, the lightest superpartner in many supersymmetric theories. We review the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model and discuss prospects for detection of neutralino dark matter. We review in detail how to calculate the cosmological abundance of the neutralino and the event rates for both direct- and indirect-detection schemes, and we discuss astrophysical and laboratory constraints on supersymmetric models. We isolate and clarify the uncertainties from particle physics, nuclear physics, and astrophysics that enter at each step in the calculation. We briefly review other related dark-matter candidates and detection techniques.},

These models have self-interactions large enough to change dark matter densities in the centers of galaxies in accord with observations, while remaining compatible with large-scale structure data and all astrophysical observations such as halo shapes and the Bullet Cluster. These observations favor a mediator mass in the 10 - 100 MeV range and large regions of this parameter space are accessible to direct detection experiments like LUX, SuperCDMS, and XENON1T.},

Due to the collision of two clusters, the dissipationless stellar component and the fluid-like X-ray emitting plasma are spatially segregated. By using both wide-field ground based images and HST/ACS images of the cluster cores, we create gravitational lensing maps which show that the gravitational potential does not trace the plasma distribution, the dominant baryonic mass component, but rather approximately traces the distribution of galaxies. An 8-sigma significance spatial offset of the center of the total mass from the center of the baryonic mass peaks cannot be explained with an alteration of the gravitational force law, and thus proves that the majority of the matter in the system is unseen.},

abstract = {Dark matter is one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in cosmology at the present time. About 80{\%} of the universe's gravitating matter is non-luminous, and its nature and distribution are for the most part unknown. In this paper, we will outline the history, astrophysical evidence, candidates, and detection methods of dark matter, with the goal to give the reader an accessible but rigorous introduction to the puzzle of dark matter. This review targets advanced students and researchers new to the field of dark matter, and includes an extensive list of references for further study.},

@article{Buckley2014,
abstract = {We demonstrate that self-interacting dark matter models with interactions mediated by light particles can have significant deviations in the matter power-spectrum and detailed structure of galactic halos when compared to a standard cold dark matter scenario. While these deviations can take the form of suppression of small scale structure that are in some ways similar to that of warm dark matter, the self-interacting models have a much wider range of possible phenomenology. A long-range force in the dark matter can introduce multiple scales to the initial power spectrum, in the form of dark acoustic oscillations and an exponential cut-off in the power spectrum. Using simulations we show that the impact of these scales can remain observationally relevant up to the present day. Furthermore, the self-interaction can continue to modify the small-scale structure of the dark matter halos, reducing their central densities and creating a dark matter core. The resulting phenomenology is unique to this type of models.},

@article{Rubin1970,
abstract = {Spectia of sixty-seven H Ir regions from 3 to 24 kpc from the nucleus of M31 have been obtained with the DTM image-tube spectrograph at a dispersion of 135 A mm '. Radial velocities, principally from Ha, have been determined with an accuracy of 10 km sec ' for most regions. Rotational velocities have been calculated under the assumption of circular motions only. For the region interior to 3 kpc where no emission regions have been identified, a narrow [N 13] x6583 emission line is observed. Velocities from this line indicate a rapid rotation in the nucleus, rising to a maximum circular velocity of V = 225 km at R = 400 pc, and falling to a deep minimum near R = 2 kpc. From the rotation curve for R {\textless} 24 kpc, the following disk model of M31 results. There is a dense, rapidly rotating nucleus of mass Al = (6 i 1) x 10' Alo. Near R = 2 kpc, the density is very low and the rotational motions are very small. In the region from 500 to 1.4 kpc (most notably on the southeast minor axis), gas is observed leaving the nucleus. Beyond R = 4 kpc the total mass of the galaxy increases approximately linearly to R = 14 kpc, and more slowly thereafter. The total mass to R = 24 kpc is = (1 85 t 0.1) x 10" Alo; one-half of it is located in the disk interior to R = 9 kpc In many respects this model resembles the model of the disk of our Galaxy Outside the nuclear region, there is no evidence for noncircular motions. The optical velocities, R {\textgreater} 3 kpc, agree with the 21-cm observations, although the maximum rotational velocity, V = 270 t 10 km sec ', is slightly higher than that obtained from 21-cm observations.},
